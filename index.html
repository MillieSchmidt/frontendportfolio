                            I decided to store my pictures on my own website instead of on Facebook or Instagram, so I built this site. It is primarily 
                            meant for web but can be viewed on your smartphone as well. I used React for it, because 
                            I figured it would be easier and faster, and I wanted a challenge to advance my React skills.

                            I started with building one specific gallery, and only when it worked properly, I generalized my code so that 
                            I'll be able to use it for all of the galleries in this site. It's simpler to solve one problem at a time.

                            This React app was created out of two tutorials I found on Youtube, and decided to combine and make something a 
                            bit more original. It was developed primarily for mobile.

                            Of course, this app would work much better with a backend, but I wanted to develop my frontend skills. So, 
                            instead of storing the data in an actual DB, it is stored in a JS object directly in the DOM. If you add an item 
                            to the list and refresh the page, it will disappear. Please understand that this is just a frontend exercise.

                            I decided to take the user straight to the about page, because I figured I should explain this is not a fully working

                            and shows them for the user to enjoy. We were supposed to do something pretty solid with the background, but I 
                            decided to improvise and give it the same image that is displayed by the user's choice of a breed. I think it makes 
                            the whole site more interesting.

                                one and the king mole. First I declared all the functions to deal with all those changes, by adding or removing 
                                classes. Then I used setInterval and inside it set the setTimeouts to call each function after a certain amount of 
                                millieseconds had passed. I know it's less elegant than requestAnimationFrame, but I think for the purpose of this

                            The script is based on setTimeouts and setIntervals, which call pre-defined functions that cause the moles to change state. 
                            You must feed the moles to gain points, and with each point you gain, the worm at the top of the page gets longer. This is 
                            a simple CSS trick based on "overflow: hidden" and a little help from the JS script.
